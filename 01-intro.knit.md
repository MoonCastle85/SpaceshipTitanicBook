# Early data exploration
## Overview of the data
The data has already been divided into train and test sets so let's load them and get a sense of how the *train* data looks like. We'll also try to be very strict with the machine learning principles and not touch or even look at the *test* data until the end. 

Let's first get a sense of the train data.

```r
train <- read.csv("train.csv", na.strings = "")
str(train)
#> 'data.frame':	8693 obs. of  14 variables:
#>  $ PassengerId : chr  "0001_01" "0002_01" "0003_01" "0003_02" ...
#>  $ HomePlanet  : chr  "Europa" "Earth" "Europa" "Europa" ...
#>  $ CryoSleep   : chr  "False" "False" "False" "False" ...
#>  $ Cabin       : chr  "B/0/P" "F/0/S" "A/0/S" "A/0/S" ...
#>  $ Destination : chr  "TRAPPIST-1e" "TRAPPIST-1e" "TRAPPIST-1e" "TRAPPIST-1e" ...
#>  $ Age         : num  39 24 58 33 16 44 26 28 35 14 ...
#>  $ VIP         : chr  "False" "False" "True" "False" ...
#>  $ RoomService : num  0 109 43 0 303 0 42 0 0 0 ...
#>  $ FoodCourt   : num  0 9 3576 1283 70 ...
#>  $ ShoppingMall: num  0 25 0 371 151 0 3 0 17 0 ...
#>  $ Spa         : num  0 549 6715 3329 565 ...
#>  $ VRDeck      : num  0 44 49 193 2 0 0 NA 0 0 ...
#>  $ Name        : chr  "Maham Ofracculy" "Juanna Vines" "Altark Susent" "Solam Susent" ...
#>  $ Transported : chr  "False" "True" "False" "False" ...
```

There are 8693 observations and 14 variables where "Transported" is the target variable. The specifics on the different variables are explained in detail on the competition website so I won't repeat them here. It's enough to note that there is a mix of categorical and continuous variables and that our target variable is expressed as True/False in a character vector.

## Do some variables have zero or near-zero variance?
One of the first things that might be useful to check is whether any of the variables have zero or near-zero variance. A zero variance variable is one where all rows have the same value (imagine a variable where all rows are just the number 1). Such variables are not useful for prediction since they don't change regardless of how the target variable changes.

Their close cousin are the near-zero variances where a high percentage of the rows have the same value but some don't. This can be particularly problematic when we want to do repeated cross validation where we divide the data into subdata to test our models. Some of these subdata might then have zero variance while other subdata might get a high variance for the same variable.
