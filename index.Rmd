# Introduction
My name is Vanja Manborg and ever since I got to dabble in data science through my (not so much data-science focused) engineering job, I've spent my free time in RStudio instead of things like family, friends and going to the movies. That's still normal, right? 

I believe in learning-by-doing methodology so this is my attempt to get relatively high scores for the [Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) on Kaggle and learn new concepts and tricks of data-science while I'm at it. The competition is a futuristic version of the Titanic challenge where the goal is to predict with as high accuracy as possible which of the space-faring passengers got transported to another dimension during the spaceships maiden voyage from our solar system to another.

Note that I won't go into details about the packages or their functions but expect you to check them out for yourself. Also, I imagine that you the reader is following along so when I write "*We* then do x", I mean you and myself and not the voices in my head (although they are there, too). 

Without further ado, let's dive into it!
