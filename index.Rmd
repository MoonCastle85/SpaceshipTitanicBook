# Introduction
My name is Vanja Manborg and ever since I got to dabble in data science through my engineering job, I've spent my free time in RStudio instead of things like family, friends and going to the movies. I believe in learning-by-doing methodology so this is my attempt to get relatively high scores for the [Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) on Kaggle and learn new concepts and tricks of data-science while I'm at it. The competition is a futuristic version of the Titanic challenge where the goal is to predict with as high accuracy as possible which of the space-faring passengers got transported to another dimension during the spaceships maiden voyage from our solar system to another.

Some formalities:

- I won't go into details about the packages or their functions

- I've relied on the excellent Max Kuhn's and Kjell Johnson's book ['Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models'](http://www.feat.engineering/) and used some of their code for the more advanced feature exploration.

Without further ado, let's dive into it!

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(parallel)
library(doSNOW)
library(glmulti)
library(patchwork)
library(caret)
library(dlookr)
library(missRanger)
library(ggstats)
library(htmltools)
library(sjPlot)

theme_set(ggthemes::theme_clean(base_size = 24))

unregister <- function() { # Helper function to unregister parallel processes that didn't shut down for some reason
  env <- foreach:::.foreachGlobals
  rm(list=ls(name=env), pos=env)
}
```
